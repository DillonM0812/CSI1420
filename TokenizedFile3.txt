This course is designated to extend the students knowledge of and provide additional handson experience with the programming language encountered in CSC in the context of the structured data types provided by that language and within the larger contexts of abstract data types and more complex problemsolving situations Techniques for managing file input and output in the current language will also be studied A number of classical algorithms and data structures for the storage manipulation of information of various kinds in a computers internal memory will be studied The student will acquire the knowledge that comes from actually implementing a nontrivial abstract data type and the experience that comes from having to make use as a client programmer of an abstract type that has already been implemented
